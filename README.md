This script creates a simple teleportation GUI in Roblox, letting you enter a player’s name and teleport to them.

How It Works

You’ll see a small GUI with a text box and a “Teleport” button. Type in a player’s name, click the button, and if that player exists in the game, you’ll teleport to them. If they’re not found or their character isn’t available, nothing happens.

What’s in the Script?

A Frame that holds everything.

A TextBox where you type a player’s name.

A Button that triggers the teleport.

A Function that checks if the player exists and moves you to them.


If the name is empty or the player isn’t found, the script won’t do anything.
